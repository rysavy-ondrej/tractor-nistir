# A.1: Unencrypted Passwords Are Used to Access a Networking Device

## Description
Unencrypted or plaintext passwords transmitted over a network are a vulnerability for
industrial control system (ICS) networks. If packets containing these credentials are
intercepted, then the passwords can be easily unmasked and can be used to obtain
unauthorized access to devices or services that use those credentials. This vulnerability can
be amplified if multiple devices utilize the same credentials.

## Scenario
The network switches router provides a Telnet service for remote management. 
This protocol transmits user credentials as plaintext. A
Telnet connection was opened between the engineering workstation and ICS ControlSystem LAN
by using the open-source PuTTY client.
